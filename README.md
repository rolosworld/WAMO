What Are My Options?

Web App to figure out what options the player has based on the frame data.

The program will display the list of options available and the amount of frames the player has to press the button. 

Example: 
```
stand LP [-](1)
```

Where "stand LP [-]" is the name of the move and "(1)" is the amount of frames the user has to press the button, in this case the user has 1 frame so this is a 1 frame link situation.
